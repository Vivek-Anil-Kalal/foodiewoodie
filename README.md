### What is its about :- FoodieWoodie is platform for the localities shops .

### How did we got the idea :- 
- we observed that some of the local shops are there which are just nothing more than a stall but they are having massive amount of crowd on there stall .
- and the sometimes face a lot issues to manage that much of crowd if there is only one man then he has toh manage the acceptance of order , making the item and also giving to particular person who have ordered it
- our Sunday routine.


### Our solution :- so will act as a pre-booking partner for them and also promoting there food items even more in area by suggesting users famous and top selling items of stores . 
- will provide online booking for the listed items of that store and pre-payment through app and generate an unique QR/OTP for them which he/she can scan at stall and can get his food item without need to standing in queue .
